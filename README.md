Mad Jack's cyber range instrumentation

Named after Mad Jack Churchill, the Mad Jack's Range is used by SOFWERX to produce relevant data sets pertaining to home automation devices. Using that data, we hope to evaluate software and combine open-source information, technology, and software to build prototypes to assist in defend against attacks targeting a home network.

In planning this project, we used a number of readily-available devices from manufacturers such as Google or Amazon. All the devices that were tested are available for purchase on the open-market. Also, the software and software prototypes were also open-source.

The physical scenario of the exercise was built around the concept of war games. With war games, there are always biases on each side of the battle; however, what insights, information, and questions arise before, during and after an operation? These questions could not be addressed until the Mad Jackâ€™s Range began research in January 2018.
