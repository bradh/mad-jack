## Station - Computer Configuration
Any type of computing device which can run Linux is a suitable choice as long as the the hardware capabilities meet the computing needs of the software being run. In most cases this will require a system more powerful than a Raspberry Pi but less powerful then a standard desktop computer.

Configurating the computer which will execute and host all the activity of a node needs to be able to support the needed software and hardware, because of this a Linux based operating systems is critical. Within the project a Ubuntu based version of Linux was used, Pop OS. However any version newer then 17.10 of Ubuntu will be suitable. In the following Guide a step by step process covers the process of setting a device up with [Pop OS](https://linoxide.com/distros/install-pop_os-system76/).
