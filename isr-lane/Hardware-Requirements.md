This page will suggest hardware requirements for computers used in the Safe House project. These recommendations are not set in stone; these are the basic requirements of the more critical applications used in the project. The page will wrap up with the specifications of the machines used in this instance of the project.

## Domoticz System Requirements
Domoticz is a relatively lightweight application, and can even run reliably on mobile devices or single-board computers like a Raspberry Pi.
The Domoticz  team recommends:
* Minimum 256MB RAM
* 200MB free storage space
* 1280 x 1024 screen resolution or higher
* Up-to-date Chrome, Firefox, or Safari; Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer 10+

## Elasticsearch System Requirements
The Elastic Guide does not provide hardware requirements. Rather, they acknowledge that specifications rely on the scale of the Elasticsearch system, and provide general recommendations. The following is a summary.
* At least 16GB RAM, ideally 64GB.
* Modern (within last 5 years) multi-core processor
* At least 1GbE, data-center networking
* SSDs, or at least 15k RPM HDDs

## Docker System Requirements
Requirements may change depending on the container application being used. Generally, a machine with a 64-bit processor is recommended.
