This page will outline installation of the August Smart Lock into the door of your safehouse, as well as registration with August's smart phone app, and August Connect installation for Wi-Fi functionality. Wi-Fi Internet connection is required.

## August App download
The August App is very helpful in regards to setup and support of its products, including an interactive step-by-step installation guide with videos. You can use the application's instructions if you wish. Either way, the app is required for keyless operation. It's available for Android and iOS.

Additionally, a PDF of the installation manual can be viewed [here](http://august.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/August-Smart-Lock-Install-Guide.pdf).


## Physical installation
The lock requires a single-cylinder deadbolt, and lends itself well to retrofitting on doors already having this type of lock. The following is a brief summary of this process. For more detailed instructions, consult the manual linked above, or the August app itself.

  1\. Tape over the keyed side of the lock to keep it in place during installation.

  2\. On the other side of the door, unscrew the thumb turn from your existing deadbolt.

  3\. Position the screws from the thumb turn into the mounting plate included with the August lock. The screwholes are adaptable to your deadbolt. Tightly mount the plate onto the door in place of the thumbturn.

  4\. Select the appropriate adapter for your deadbolt's tail piece. Consult the table or graphic below to select the correct one.

| Brand       | Adapter           |
| ------------- |--------------:|
| Baldwin - Estate/Images      | Blue |
| Baldwin - Reserve/Prestige      | Green      |
| Defiant | Blue     |
| Dexter (by Schlage) |  Blue     |
| Emtek | Blue    |
| Kwikset | Green     |
| Omnia | Blue      |
| Schlage | Yellow     |
| Weiser | Blue      |

5\.  On the August lock, set the thumb turn to a fully unlocked position. Turn the unit over and open the winged latched on both sides.

6\. Place the lock onto the tail piece adapter on the door, and close down the winged latches on both sides so secure the lock on the mounting plate. The back of the lock should be flush with the door.

7\. Finally, slide the battery cover up and off the smart lock. This lid covers the top half-circle shape on the lock. Remove the battery tab, replace the lid, and remove the tape on the other side of the door. This completes physical setup.


## Configuration
The lock is configured from the August Home app. Ensure that you've installed it from your device's app store.
1. Ensure Bluetooth is enabled on your phone. Open the August app and register for a free account.
2. When finished, you'll be in your home screen. Tap the hamburger icon on the top left, and choose **Set Up New Device**.
3. Choose the top option on the next screen **Set Up August Smart Lock**.
4. Choose the second option from the top in the next screen **August Smart Lock 3rd Generation**.
5. Tap **Skip** if you've already installed the lock onto your door. Otherwise, follow the on-screen, interactive tutorial to get you up and running.
6. Tap **Start Setup** on the bottom right of the screen. The application will now use your phone's Bluetooth capability to scan for August devices nearby. Complete connection and calibration on the app.

## August connect
Our next step is to configure the August Connect to give our lock Wi-Fi, and in turn, data pushing and monitoring capability. The process is almost identical to the smart lock in that it must be done through the August mobile app.
1. Ensure that both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are active on your mobile device.
2. Hook the Connect hub to a power outlet, and make every attempt to get position the Connect hub as close to the smart lock as possible.
3. Press the button on the front side of the August Connect to enable pairing mode.
4. On your mobile phone, select the hamburger menu on the top left, and tap **Set Up a New Device**.
5. Choose **August Connect** from the list of devices.
6. The app will guide you through the rest of the pairing process.

You are now able to monitor the lock and receive notifications remotely.
