From the perspective of the ISR lane, the safe house is intended to consist of affordable devices widely available on the consumer market. I'll divide the devices into two groups: security devices and smart devices. Wrapping up will be some considerations to keep in mind when choosing other devices for the safe house.

# Security Devices
## Vstarcam C7837WIP Wireless IP Camera
![](http://www.eye4.so/FAQ/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/c37a.jpg)

This wireless camera records at 720p and supports ONVIF 2.0 and RTSP streaming protocols. Although the device is plug an play ready for immediate use with Vstarcam's proprietary cloud services, finding the device on your network may be a little tedious, especially if you have several devices connected. I recommend using Vstarcam's device location app. The app has a Windows and MacOS version, but it runs hassle-free on a VM with a Linux host:

* **Windows:** http://download2.eye4.cn/download2/application/app-find-vstarcam.zip
* **MacOS:** http://download2.eye4.cn/download2/application/app-Find-T-Mac.zip

You can use the device's full network address to access it's GUI and video streams.
